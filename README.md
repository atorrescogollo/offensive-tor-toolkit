# Offensive Tor Toolkit
**Offensive Tor Toolkit** is a series of tools that simplify the use of Tor for typical **exploitation and post-exploitation tasks**.

In exploitation and post-exploitation phases, the victim needs to access Tor. All of this tools have an **embedded instance of Tor** and they are completely separated from each other. In this way, you only need to upload one file to the victim in order to run the required action.

Please, read the [**docs**](https://atorrescogollo.github.io/geekdoc/projects/offensive-tor-toolkit/) for more information.
